# The Java EE Utility Belt

The Java EE platform became so complex over the years that it's extremelly difficult to use this technology stack without serious investiments on tools, techniques and training. After all those investiments, we realised there are still a lot of work to do to finally achieve faire compentitiviness compared to other technologies such as Ruby, Python, Scala and Clojure.

This project aims to fullfil the gap to effective productivity on the development of Java EE projects.

Despite helping Java EE projects to succeed, this project is entirelly written in Clojure. This choice was made because one cannot honestly see the problems on the Java EE platform if he/she doesn't work with a better tecnology. 

## Installation

This project is just starting. So, there is no installation package at the moment. The user should be capable of cloning the project and running it from the source code.

## Usage

We assume you already have JDK 8 and Leiningen installed and configured. We also assume you have basic knowledge about Clojure programming language to write commands syntactically correct in the REPL.
